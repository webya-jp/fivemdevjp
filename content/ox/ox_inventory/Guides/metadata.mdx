# Metadata

Item metadata is a very powerful tool that can be used to create multiple different items out of a single item.

In this guide we'll use pokemon cards as an example, but you can find an already integrated example in the inventory
with the `garbage` item.

## Creating the base item

First of all we need to create a base item that we'll use to apply metadata to.

```lua filename="/data/items.lua"
['pokemon_card'] = {
    label = 'Pokemon card',
    weight = 10,
    consume = 0,
    server = {
        export = 'pokemon.pokemon_card'
    }
}
```

In this case we define the label and the weight as well since we are going to have all the cards weigh the same, but if you
do not want them all to weigh the same you can leave it out and apply weight through metadata.

We'll also make the item usable by calling the `pokemon_card` export in the `pokemon` resource.

```lua filename="pokemon/server.lua"
exports('pokemon_card', function(event, item, inventory, slot, data)
    if event == 'usingItem' then
        local itemSlot = exports.ox_inventory:GetSlot(inventory.id, slot)
        print(json.encode(itemSlot.metadata, {indent=true}))
    end
end)
```

## Special metadata properties

You can define any metadata property with any value you want it to have, but there are a couple metadata properties that
have special use cases.

These properties are:

- label: `string`
  - Display name of the item
- weight: `number`
  - Amount the item will weigh
- description: `string`
  - Description of the item that will be displayed in the tooltip
- image: `string`
  - Image inside the image path that the item will use
- imageurl: `string`
  - Url to the image that the item will use
- type: `any`
  - Item type that is displayed in top right of the tooltip

We'll use these properties to create our pokemon cards out of the `pokemon_card` item that we created earlier.

## Creating metadata items

We can easily create metadata items by defining a hook using [createItem](../Functions/Server/Hooks#createitem) and adding it to a shop as well.

```lua filename="/data/shops.lua"
inventory = {
    {name = 'pokemon_card', price = 300, metadata = {
        label = 'Charizard',
        description = 'It is said that Charizard’s fire burns hotter if it has experienced harsh battles.',
        image = 'panties',
        type = 'Fire',
        hp = 78,
        attack = 84,
        defense = 78
    }}
}
```

```lua filename="pokemon/server.lua"
local pokemonMetadata = {
    charizard = {
        label = 'Charizard',
        description = 'It is said that Charizard’s fire burns hotter if it has experienced harsh battles.',
        image = 'panties',
        type = 'Fire',
        hp = 78,
        attack = 84,
        defense = 78
    }
}

local hookId = exports.ox_inventory:registerHook('createItem', function(payload)
    local pokemon = pokemonMetadata[payload.metadata.type]
    if not pokemon then return end
    return pokemon
end, {
    itemFilter = {
        pokemon_card = true
    }
})
```

As seen above when our item is usable, the metadata properties are all there and accessible through the slot.

## Displaying custom metadata properties

We can display our custom metadata we set on our charizard card by either using string concatenation and adding them to
the description or by using the [displayMetadata](../Functions/Client#displaymetadata) _client_ function.

```lua
exports.ox_inventory:displayMetadata({
    hp = 'HP',
    attack = 'ATK',
    defense = 'DEF'
})
```

## Weapon components metadata

You can also create items with already attached weapon components by using the `components` metadata property.
Weapon components are defined in [data/weapons.lua](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_inventory/blob/4d178a50a225661eeadcefc5b531c52e10522191/data/weapons.lua#L721)
You can also set ammo count with the `ammo` metadata property.

```lua
local metadataExample = {
    ammo = 30,
    components = {
        'at_flashlight',
        'at_suppressor_heavy'
    }
}

exports.ox_inventory:AddItem(inv, item, count, metadataExample, slot, cb)
```
