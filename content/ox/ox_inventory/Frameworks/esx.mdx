# ESX

- You will need a [compatible version of ESX Legacy](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core) (1.6.0 or higher).
- You can convert player inventories with `convertinventory esx`.
- All items in the database will be migrated to the internal item data.
  - Always restart the resource when items are migrated!

## Compatibility

Ox Inventory is a complete replacement for existing item, inventory, and weapon systems; it is inherently incompatible with ESX and any resources that rely on default behaviour.

- Loadouts do not exist and weapons are treated as items.
- Standard shops and stashes (i.e. esx_shops, esx_weaponshop, and esx_policejob).
- Resources that alter the default esx inventory or provide a ui (i.e. esx_trunkinventory, esx_inventoryhud).

## Installation

- Use a compatible version of [ESX Legacy](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy) (1.6.0+).
- Modify your `server.cfg`, starting ox_inventory immediately after es_extended.

```yaml
start oxmysql
start ox_lib
start es_extended
start qtarget
start ox_inventory
```

## Convert ESX inventory data

- Start the server and type `convertinventory esx` into the server console.
- Optionally, type `convertinventory esxproperty` into the server console.
- Restart the server once conversion is complete.

## Optional Optimisation

All item related functions from xPlayer, such as `xPlayer.getInventoryItem`, have been modified for compatibility purposes; however they are considered deprecated.

The reasoning is fairly simple - there's now additional function references and overhead to consider. Fortunately, the new Inventory functions can be used directly and offer a great deal of improvements over the old ones.

You should read through the functions section for further information, but the following should give you a decent idea.

<Tabs items={['ESX', 'Ox Inventory']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```lua
if xPlayer.getInventoryItem('acetone').count > 2 and xPlayer.getInventoryItem('antifreeze').count > 4 and xPlayer.getInventoryItem('sudo').count > 9 then
    xPlayer.removeInventoryItem("acetone", 3)
    xPlayer.removeInventoryItem("antifreeze", 5)
    xPlayer.removeInventoryItem("sudo", 10)
end
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Add the following code somewhere in your resource to cache the exports metatable.

```lua
local ox_inventory = exports.ox_inventory
```

You will be able to reference any functions exposed through the export.

```lua
local items = ox_inventory:Search(source, 'count', {'acetone', 'antifreeze', 'sudo'})
if items and items.acetone > 2 and items.antifreeze > 4 and items.sudo > 9 then
    ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'acetone', 3)
    ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'antifreeze', 5)
    ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'sudo', 10)
end
```

</Tabs.Tab>
