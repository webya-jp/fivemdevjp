# Server

A Lua implementation of cron, allowing tasks to be scheduled to run periodically at fixed times, dates, and intervals.

## Cron expression

A string containing five values separated by white spaces, representing a set of times to execute a task.

| Field        | Valid values        |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Minutes      | `0-59`              |
| Hours        | `0-23`              |
| Day of month | `1-31`              |
| Month        | `1-12` or `jan-dec` |
| Day of week  | `1-7` or `sun-sat`  |

**Note:** Day of the week is set to match `os.date` and starts at 1, unlike the cron-standard which starts at 0.

### `*` Wildcards
Represents all values, e.g. `* * * * *` will run every minute, or `* * * * 1` will run every minute on Sunday.

### `,` Lists
Commas can be used to create a list of values, e.g. `* * * * sun,mon,tue` will run every minute on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.

### `-` Ranges
Dashes define a range of values, e.g. `10-30 * * * *` will start running the task at the 10th minute, and every minute until the 30th minute.

### `/` Steps
Slashes can be used for step values, e.g. `* */4 * * *` will run every 4 hours and is shorthand for `* 0,4,8,12,16,20 * * *`.

## Functions

### lib.cron.new

Creates a new [cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), scheduling a task to run at fixed times or intervals.  

```lua
lib.cron.new(expression, job, options)
```

- expression: `string`
  - A cron expression such as `* * * * *` representing minute, hour, day, month, and day of the week
- job: `fun(task: OxTask, date: osdate)`
- options?: `table`
  - debug?: `boolean`

Return:

- task: `OxTask`
