# Custom Permissions

The moment you invite someone to your Grafana organization, they will have access to all dashboards. However, you can restrict their access to specific dashboards by creating teams.
This way we can create dedicated log searching teams or restrict which logs a certain someone can see.

    <CardFooter className='text--center'> 
      <div className='avatar'>
        <div className='avatar__intro'>
          <div className='avatar__name'>What an invited user with the `Viewer` role would see</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </CardFooter>

First we'll remove all roles from all dashboards. For this you'll need to open each dashboard manually and click on the `Edit` button in the top right corner. And then the `Settings` button.
Here you can open the tab called `Permissions` and remove all roles. This will make sure that no one has access to any dashboard by default.

    <CardFooter className='text--center'> 
      <div className='avatar'>
        <div className='avatar__intro'>
          <div className='avatar__name'>Now the invited user won't see anything</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </CardFooter>

Next, we can create a team that will have access to the dashboard. To do this, go to `Administration > Users and access` tab in the left sidebar and click on `Teams`. Here you can create a new team by clicking on the `New team` button.
Now just give it a descriptive name and add all the users you want to this team.

  <Column>
    Now go back to the `permissions` tab of the dashboard and add the team you just created. For this example we will just give this team the `Viewer` role.
  </Column>
  <Column style={{ maxWidth: '300px', minWidth: '250px' }}>
    <CardImage cardImageUrl="https://media.qbox.re/image/98yyye6YeVKe0S4C8Gwm6L1c0yCnqrX5sv5nlsEufeA3.png" />
  </Column>
</Columns>

    <CardImage cardImageUrl="https://media.qbox.re/image/sBZx1BJ9YgBrEUm-CJA57BQUtQZ4SzPVu-tk2BPyJg0wt-.png" style={{ padding: '1rem' }} />
    <CardFooter className='text--center'> 
      <div className='avatar'>
        <div className='avatar__intro'>
          <div className='avatar__name'>Now the invited user will be able to see the dashboard again because they are a member of the team we just created</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </CardFooter> 
</Card>

This way you can create multiple teams with different roles and permissions. For example, you can create a team for developers that have access to all dashboards, and a team for moderators that only have access to specific dashboards.
This allows you to have complete control over who can see what in your Grafana organization. Just like Discord roles and adding or removing people from channels.
