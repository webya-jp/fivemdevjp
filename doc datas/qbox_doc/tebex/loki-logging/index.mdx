Loki Logging is a powerful tool that allows you to log events and messages from your FiveM server to a Loki instance. This can be useful for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing server performance.
A proper trained staff team with great logging events can literally combat any and all cheaters from your server. Understanding and knowing what is happening on your **own** server is a super duper important aspect of managing a FiveM server.

## Who is this for?

Anyone uncapable of setting up their own Loki instance, or anyone who wants to use a managed Grafana | Loki instance with zero hassle. Or looking to upgrade from the Grafana cloud free tier with only 14 days of logs retention.
:::info
I would however still recommend people with a system that has adequate storage attached to them to set up their own Grafana | Loki stack. This way you have complete control over your data
and you can setup unlimited retention periods or upto x amount of GBs worth of logs after which Loki will start deleting the oldest logs. It may seem daunting but there are plenty of guides out there to help you set it up.

## What do I get?

You have complete control over your own Grafana organization, you can create as many dashboards as you want, and you can use the Grafana Loki API to query your logs.
Add more data sources, Invite staff members and get complete control over which dashboards they can see and which not. With retention periods of 30 | 60 | 90 days, depending on your Ko-fi tier.

## What can I do with it?

Here are some example screenshots of the things possible within Grafana interfacing with Loki and your database.
