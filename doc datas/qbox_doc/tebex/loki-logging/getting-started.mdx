# Getting Started

The moment you support us on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/qbox) you will receive the appropriate roles in Discord (make sure to link your Discord account to your Ko-fi account so you actually receive your Discord benefits).

Now head to https://logging.qbox.re/ and authenticate with your Discord account. You will see a small dashboard, but this won't be used for anything besides regenerating your API key.
The moment you authenticate for the first time, a new Grafana organization will be created for you at https://grafana.qbox.re/.
Your login credentials will be your Discord ID as username and `admin` as password. Afterwhich it will ask you to change your password.

It goes without saying, but please actually do so. Change your password üôè

Once done, you will now have full control and access to your very own Grafana organization. Everything will be installed for you already to get you started.
But I would recommend you to go through the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) to get a better understanding of how Grafana works and how to use it.

## Setting up ox_lib

If you are using Qbox and ran our recipe deployer, you will have a file called `ox.cfg`. Otherwise just use `server.cfg`. Either way, search if you have already set the `ox:logger` convar.
If not, you can copy the following lines into your `server.cfg` or `ox.cfg` file:

```lua
set ox:logger "loki"
set loki:endpoint "logging.qbox.re"
set loki:tenant "tenant-id"
```

Replace `tenant-id` with your actual tenant ID, which you can find in the small dashboard at https://logging.qbox.re/. Now if you start your server and connect with it.
You should already see a few default logs showing up in Grafana. Don't know where? Navigate to `Dashboards > All Logs` inside Grafana. This will be your main dashboard for viewing all logs.

And that is it. Don't forget to bookmark both the URLs above for quick access.
