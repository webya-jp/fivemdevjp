# Installation

## Downloading the resource

Any and all resources escrowed or not will be delivered using the Cfx.re asset system. You can find the asset manager hub at the following link: https://portal.cfx.re/assets/granted-assets

## Starting the Script on FiveM

1. Place the script anywhere at the same level as your `server.cfg` or make any kind of subdirectory. You will more likely than not have a folder called `resources` where all your currently used scripts reside. You can put `qbx_casino_slots` in here as well.

2. Add the following codeblock to your `server.cfg` or any other `.cfg` that is read on server startup:

```lua
ensure qbx_casino_slots
```

That is it! This script is completely plug and play. Every and any slot machine in the world will automatically work.
