title: "Required Item"
---

Not only can you change the required item. You can change what item it takes when spinning **and** give a completely different item when the player wins! Let's navigate to `server/utils.lua`.

```lua
function CanSpin(source, betAmount)
    local itemName = 'cash'
    local itemCount = exports.ox_inventory:GetItemCount(source, itemName)

    ...
end
```

Simply change the `itemName` variable to whatever item you want to use. The same goes goes for the rewarding.

```lua
function RewardPlayer(source, winAmount)
    local itemName = 'cash'
    ...
end
```

Same changes apply here :D
