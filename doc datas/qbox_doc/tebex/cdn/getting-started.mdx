# Getting Started

The moment you support us on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/qbox) you will receive the appropriate roles in Discord (make sure to link your Discord account to your Ko-fi account so you actually receive your Discord benefits).

Now head to https://cdn.qbox.re/ and authenticate with your Discord account. From here on out you will have access to all the dashboards.
- The main dashboard will show you your current storage usage, the amount of files you have uploaded, and your API token (if generated at all).
- Next we have the file management section. Where you can upload new files, delete existing files, and view your files in either a list or grid view with filters for file types.
- And lastly we have the organization management section. Where you can create new organizations, view existing organizations, and manage your organization users.
