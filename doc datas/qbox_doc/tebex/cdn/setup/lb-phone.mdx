This guide will go over how to set up the Qbox CDN with [LB Phone](https://store.lbscripts.com/package/5356987)

## Whitelisting the CDN Domain

First we'll need to whitelist the qbox domain. Navigate to `config > config.lua` and search for the following `Config.UploadWhitelistedDomains`.
In this table you'll need to add `qbox.re` to the list of domains. It should look like this:

```lua
-- Set to false/empty to disable
Config.UploadWhitelistedDomains = { -- domains that are allowed to upload images to the phone (prevent using devtools to upload images)
    "fivemanage.com",
    "fmfile.com",
    "qbox.re",
    "cfx.re" -- lb-upload
}
```

## Changing upload method

In the same config file we will search for `Config.UploadMethod`. This will give you 3 different options for all the file types. Change them all to `qbox` like so:

```lua
Config.UploadMethod.Video = "Qbox" -- "Fivemanage" or "LBUpload" or "Custom"
Config.UploadMethod.Image = "Qbox" -- "Fivemanage" or "LBUpload" or "Custom"
Config.UploadMethod.Audio = "Qbox" -- "Fivemanage" or "LBUpload" or "Custom"
```

## Adding the Qbox upload method

Now we are done in the config file. Next we will go to `shared > upload.lua`. Here you will see a big table with all kinds of upload methods for different services.
We will be adding one for Qbox in here.
:::danger
Add this **inside** the `UploadMethods` table, alongside all the other options!
:::
```lua
Qbox = {
    Default = {
        url = "https://cdn.qbox.re/api/storage/upload",
        field = "file",
        headers = {
            ["Authorization"] = "API_KEY"
        },
        success = {
            path = "url"
        },
    },
},
```

## Adding your API key

Navigate to `server > apiKeys.lua`. Here you will see a table with all the API keys for the different upload methods. Simply add the same API key that you generated in the Qbox CDN dashboard.

```lua
API_KEYS = {
    Video = "API_KEY_HERE",
    Image = "API_KEY_HERE",
    Audio = "API_KEY_HERE",
}
```
