```

Type: `string`

## max_jobs_per_player

```

Type: `integer`

## max_gangs_per_player

```lua
set qbx:max_gangs_per_player 1
```

Type: `integer`

## setjob_replaces

```lua
set qbx:setjob_replaces "true"
```

Type: `boolean`

## setgang_replaces

Controls if the `/setgang` command replaces or adds a gang to a player.

```lua

```

Type: `boolean`

## cleanPlayerGroups

Controls if the `player_groups` SQL table is automatically cleaned of invalid groups (jobs/gangs) on startup.

```lua

```

Type: `boolean`

## allowMethodOverrides

Enables or disables the ability of resources to override existing methods in player object.

```lua
set qbx:allowMethodOverrides "true"
```

Type: `boolean`

## disableOverrideWarning

Enables or disables warning from resources overriding existing methods in player object.

```lua

## enableVehiclePersistence

When enabled, player owned vehicles deleted by the server which have persistence enabled on them (either via having spawned using `qbx.spawnVehicle` or through `exports.qbx_core:EnablePersistence`), will be respawned with the same properties as when the vehicle was deleted.
This is a fix to a FiveM bug which can result in vehicles randomly being deleted; ensuring that vehicles that players leave, will be there when they return.

```lua
setr qbx:enableVehiclePersistence "false"
```

Type: `boolean`

## vehiclePersistenceType

When set to "full", will also spawn back player owned vehicles after server restarts.

setr qbx:vehiclePersistenceType "semi"
