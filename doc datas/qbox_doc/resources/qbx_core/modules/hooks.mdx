# hooks

Event hooks allow 3rd party resources to define new behaviour without modifying your resource directly.

## registerHook

Registers a callback function to be triggered by a resource. Returning false from the callback function cancels the event

```lua
exports.my_resource:registerHook(eventName, cb)
```

- eventName: `string`
- payload: `table`

Return:

- hookId: `number`

## removeHooks

Remove a previously registered hook by it's id.
If no id is provided then all hooks registered by the resource are removed.

```lua
exports.my_resource:removeHooks(id)
```

- id?: `number`

## Usage

An example hook setup in your resource

```lua
local triggerEventHooks = require '@qbx_core.modules.hooks' -- Import triggerEventHooks function from hooks module

-- Example of some sort of event that could be in your resource
RegisterNetEvent('your_resource:server:check_condition', function(source)
    -- Checks to see if any registered hooks return false
	if not triggerEventHooks('checkCondition', {source = source, myNumber = 10}) then return end 
    -- Do stuff
end)
```

Now a 3rd party resource can modify the behavior of your resource without having to change any of your code

```lua
exports.qbx_core:registerHook('checkCondition', function(payload)
  -- payload contains everything passed into triggerEventHooks, which will depend on the resource to document
  if payload.myNumber == 10 then
    return true -- Continue as normal
  else
    return false -- Stop execution
  end
end)
```
