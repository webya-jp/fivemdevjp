# Hooks

Event hooks allow 3rd party resources to define new behavior without modifying qbx_vehicles code directly.

## registerHook

Registers a callback function to be triggered by a resource. Returning false from the callback function cancels the event

```lua
exports.qbx_vehicles:registerHook(eventName, function(payload) end)
```

- eventName: `string`
- payload: `table`

Return:

- hookId: `number`

### createPlayerVehicle

Triggered when a new vehicle is created. Return `false` to cancel the creation

- payload: `table`
    - citizenid: `string`
    - garage: `string`
    - props: table

### changeVehicleOwner

Triggered when a vehicle's owner changes. Return `false` to cancel the change.

- payload: `table`
    - vehicleId: `integer`
    - newCitizenId: `string`

## removeHooks

Remove a previously registered hook by it's id.
If no id is provided then all hooks registered by the resource are removed.

```lua
exports.qbx_vehicles:removeHooks(id)
```

- id?: `number`
