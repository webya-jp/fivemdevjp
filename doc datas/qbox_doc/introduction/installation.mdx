## Installation Steps

### 1. Download the server

Download the latest [FiveM artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and extract the files. Do not use the buttons at the top. Download directly from the list.

### 2. Extract the artifacts

Now extract the `server.7z` with any archive manager of your choosing. We recommend using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). Extract it as `/server` so you keep the server folder name.

### 3. Starting the server

Open the folder you just extracted it to. It should look a little like this. And then run `FXServer.exe`.

Run `FXServer.exe` to start txAdmin and follow all the steps.

### 5. Deploy the recipe

When prompted, select `Popular Recipes` and then `QBox Framework`:
