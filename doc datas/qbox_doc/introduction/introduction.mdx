# Introduction

Qbox is a FiveM roleplay framework created on September 27, 2022.

Starting as a QBCore fork, its goal was improving upon QBCore while maintaining backwards compatibility. \
Today this framework strives to be much greater, and utilizes [overextended's resources](https://github.com/CommunityOx) to achieve its goals.

:::note[Read here]
We are however not affiliated with the Overextended team. They are their own entity and we simply utilize their resources.
The name Qbox was simply a derivative from the name Qbus. It just so happens to have the term "ox" in it.
